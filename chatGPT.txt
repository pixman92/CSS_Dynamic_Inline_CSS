javascript - use lots of comments

make a function that takes in CSS text and an HTML element's ID.
based on the media breakpoints 'sm/md/lg/xl', take the CSS text ('sm/md/lg/xl',) that follows the current media breakpoint. and add it to a string (saved String), when you have iterated through all CSS text, add 'saved string' to the HTML element's attribute's style string

example:
sm:color[red] - this makes the HTML element's color to red, when the screen width is small
my element:
style="color:red"

example:
sm:font-size[20px] sm:color[blue] md:margin-top[80px] md:font-size[25px]

example: (for sm screensize)
style="font-size:20px; color:blue;"

example: (for md screensize)
style="margin-top:80px; font-size:25px;"

also, an example for when there is only a media breakpoint, a ':' and [ and ] - where the text inside the [ and ] is a predefined class
example:
sm:[center] - center is a predefined class


take all the CSS text, that match the current media breakpoint, and reapply them everytime the window width resizes
